The straight man among his group of friends, this semi-fictionalized version of comedian Jerry Seinfeld was named after, co-created by, based on, and played by Seinfeld himself. The series revolves around Jerry's misadventures with his best friend George Costanza, neighbor Cosmo Kramer, and ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes. He is usually the voice of reason amidst his friends' antics and the focal point of the foursome's relationship.</p></div></div><div role="presentation" class="panel panel-default"><div id="elaine-tab" role="tab" aria-expanded="false" aria-selected="false" class="panel-heading"><span>Elaine</span></div><div role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="elaine-tab" aria-hidden="true" class="panel-body"><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Benes">Elaine's Wikipedia page</a></p><p>Elaine Marie Benes is a fictional character on the American television sitcom Seinfeld (1989&dash;1998), played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

The character is loosely based on comedian Kenny Kramer, Larry David's former neighbor across the hall. Kramer is the friend and neighbor of main character Jerry Seinfeld, residing in Apartment 5B, and is friends with George Costanza and Elaine Benes. Of the series' four central characters, only Kramer has no visible means of support; what few jobs he holds seem to be nothing more than larks.</p></div></div></div><a href="#after">After</a><script src="index.js"></script></body></html>
